			<p>Too much to do, not enough time?  Wish you had an extra pair of hands sometimes?   I would love to help!  I provide all types of errand running and general assistance (think leaf raking, event set-up, moving help) -- anything to save you time and make your life a little easier.</p>
			<p>How does it work?  Simple!  Get in touch via email or phone and let me know what you need.  I have a list of possible services, but these are meant to be general suggestions, not limitations.  Really, the only limits are your imagination (plus applicable state and federal laws).</p>
			<p>
			YIKES!  Need something RIGHT NOW?  I might be able to help.  Give me a call, and if I'm not on a current assignment, I can take care of your errand pronto!  I am only available for immediate help weekdays 9:00 am through 1:00 pm, and weekends (pretty much all day).

		<div id="about_content" class="content">
			<p>I am a mother whose small daughter recently started school, leaving me with extra time on my hands.  A full-time job wouldn't work with her schedule, and besides I realized that I like being my own boss.  I wanted to do something to help all the busy, stressed-out people out there, so here I am!</p>
			<p>I have an ultra-reliable car, and I am punctual, honest, and hard-working.  I am also a licensed attorney!</p>
